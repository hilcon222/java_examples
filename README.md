# java_examples
This is a repository that I use to keep my very first programs in Java, a language that I just started to learn. I'm trying to write the best code I possibly could, so that if someone of you wants to use my libraries for any reason, he could do that.
Althought, I obviously give no guarantee that I will keep these simple libraries updated.
I have no problem if you copy this code for whatever reason, just don't say you wrote it.
